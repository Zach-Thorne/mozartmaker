# The MozartMaker  
The MozartMaker is a device that will teach new users how to play the piano, and help experienced musicians perfect their skills. It has a learning mode for beginners and a testing mode for advanced players, both easy to navigate within one desktop application. With a projector indicating the keys to be pressed, audio processing to provide feedback on the user's performance, and an option for users to scan the sheet music for their song of choice, the MozartMaker is the new innovative tool for people of any skill level looking to learn and practice on their own time with live feedback.
The MozartMaker aims to increase accessibility and availability of effective learning methods for the piano, while reducing the overall cost. This innovative solution caters to users with varying levels of experience, from beginners who have never played piano, to experts looking to hone their skills.
